## 🎓 Development Journey

This project was developed as part of my Digital Technology class at Mount Albert Grammar School. It represents:

- Learning 3D game development from scratch
- Understanding physics-based gameplay mechanics
- Creating custom 3D assets in Blender
- Implementing UI/UX design principles
- Version control with Git and GitHub

### Development Timeline

- **July 2022** - Initial prototype and 2D concept
- **June 2023** - Transition to 3D gameplay
- **August 2023** - Vertical slice with core mechanics
- **October 2023** - Multi-level system and final polish
